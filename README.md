# Fun Scripts
Various collection of scripts I've written / found and changed over the years

<h3> IP_Setter.bat  </h3>
A relatively basic script to set IP configuration.  

<h3> OneDrive_Toggle.ps1  </h3>
Turns OneDrive on or off via local group policy settings

<h3> sethc_hack.bat  </h3>
This automatically enables the sethc.exe hack, by replacing the vulnerable Sticky Keys executable (sethc.exe) with the command prompt.  Can be used to maintain admin access to a computer you have temporary access to.  This will make your computer less secure.

<h3> spotify_hack.bat  </h3>
Written by someone much smarter than me, think it has an embedded executable or something in it...no idea, just wanted to save it here because I always lose it.
