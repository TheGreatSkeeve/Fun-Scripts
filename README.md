# Fun Scripts
Various collection of scripts I've written / found and changed over the years

<h3> IP_Setter.bat  </h3>
A relatively basic script to set IP configuration.  

<h3> OneDrive_Toggle.ps1  </h3>
Turns OneDrive on or off via local group policy settings

<h3> sethc_hack.bat  </h3>
This automatically enables the sethc.exe hack, by replacing the vulnerable Sticky Keys executable (sethc.exe) with the command prompt.  Can be used to maintain admin access to a computer you have temporary access to.  This will make your computer less secure.

<h3> spotify_hack.bat  </h3>
[Written by someone much smarter than me](https://github.com/master131/BlockTheSpot), think it has an embedded executable or something in it...no idea, just wanted to save it here because I always lose it.  It removes existing versions of Spotify, and installs an older version that's embedded in the batch file.  This older version is not compatible with Spotify's Ads system (Or something like that) and does not play any ads.   There are lots of other solutions, but this is my favorite I've found.
